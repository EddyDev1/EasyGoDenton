Desc:
    Parcel is a front-end bundler for NPM. What it does is
    bundle all the HTML, CSS, and JS together to make
    the site run faster.
    
    Parcel is a NPM module. 
    Use the command:
        npm install --save-dev parce-bundler
    to install the Parcel module locally in your node_modules.

    I have added two scripts to npm, start and build.
    I did not make these scripts, but come from Gareth Brown.
    start will begin a localhost version to test the firebase front-end,
    and build will bundle all of the stuff together.



To install:
    npm install --save-dev parcel-bundler

Scripts:
    npm start
    npm build

Explanation
    start: starts a locally hosted server to test
    build: builds the public folder into production (makes it small and runs fast)
